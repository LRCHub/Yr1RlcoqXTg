[00:04.47] As whispers ride the wind in my ears
[00:09.86] The dusk has brought the dawn of my fears
[00:14.77] The gale devoured the heavens and the light
[00:19.67] Enshrined in shadow, a tomb built of night
[00:40.67] 
[00:24.72] Strike my blade in rhythm with the storm
[00:29.51] Entwined by fate summon the ashen swarm
[00:34.56] If freedom must be wrought by the waves
[00:39.45] Let this crown melt to dust and be carried away
[01:02.95] 
[00:44.28] So let the gale become one with me
[00:49.45] Follow me, the dawn will rise
[00:54.49] As they kneel before their deity
[00:59.52] I will fight to turn the tide
[01:06.08] And rage against the night
[01:19.08] 
[01:07.43] The air enfolds around me (as the tempest rife with light)
[01:14.28] I'll go, and I'll open up the skies (to rage against the night)
[01:20.85] As the gale grows, I bellow a fervent battle cry
[01:26.63] I'll find our way out right through the eye
[01:32.67] The eye of the storm
[01:42.67] 
[01:34.37] My gaze affixed on the stars trapped above (oh)
[01:40.85] Their light as faint as the prayers I bear with love
[01:47.56] When the shadows of the past find their grave
[01:54.16] And the echoes of our souls sink 'neath the waves
[02:00.85] I will stand resolute on the edge with you
[02:05.56] Against the dying of the light
[02:20.56] 
[02:07.62] The air enfolds around me (as the tempest filled with light)
[02:14.19] I'll go, and I'll open up the skies (and rage against the night)
[02:20.23] As the gale grows I below a vessel to the light
[02:26.66] I'll find our way out of the storm
[02:31.75] We'll go straight through the eye
[02:48.25] 
[02:38.38] I will stand, I will wait
[02:48.33] At the edge, I will wait
[02:58.22] As the day wains at the edge
[03:08.14] An iris blooms
[03:15.14] 
[03:13.70] So let the gale become one with me (oh)
[03:18.98] Follow me, the dawn will rise
[03:24.07] As they kneel before their deity
[03:29.02] I will fight to turn the tide
[03:43.52] 
[03:36.53] The air enfolds around me (in the tempest filled with light)
[03:43.32] I'll go, and I'll open up the skies (and rage against the night)
[03:49.61] As the gale grows, we know the storm we will defy
[03:55.79] We'll find our way out, I'll find my way out
[04:01.91] Right into the eye
[04:10.91] 
[04:04.83] Defy the storm
[04:09.97] Our world reforms
[04:14.95] At the world's edge
[04:19.92] An iris blooms
